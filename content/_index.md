# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Government at Harvard University. My research interests lie broadly in Comparative Political Economy and Political Behavior. I am mainly interested in the politics of inequality and welfare state development in advanced capitalistic democracies. At Harvard, I am affiliated with the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) and the [Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/).

Before coming to Harvard, I received my BSc and MSc in Political Science (_Statskundskab_) at the University of Copenhagen. While studying, I taught Quantitative Methods and Comparative Politics, worked as a research assistant at Aarhus University, and worked in consulting. I regularly contribute to the leading national newspapers in Denmark, where a list of my writings can be seen on my [media page](https://marchvidkjaer.github.io//media/).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis and cooking. I hold three passports, and I used one of them to become the [second best handball goalkeeper on the second worst team in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Men%27s_Junior_World_Handball_Championship). I had stage IV Classic Hodgkin lymphoma in 2022, which I wrote [this article about](https://www.berlingske.dk/kronikker/fremskridt-bliver-konkret-naar-man-faar-kraeft-som-22-aarig). I'm all good now, but not as [wise as I thought I'd be](http://medandreord.dk/jeg-troede-at-jeg-ville-blive-klogere/). If you want to play tennis, discuss research, or anything else, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
